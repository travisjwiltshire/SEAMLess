## 1. Correlation (revisited)

### Covariance

- Calculate the error between the mean and each subject’s score for the first variable (x).
- Calculate the error between the mean and their score for the second variable (y).
- Multiply these error values.
- Add these values and you get the cross product deviations.
- The covariance is the average cross-product deviations:


$$cov(x,y)=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}(x_{i}-\bar{x})(y_{i}-\bar{y})}{N-1}$$


### Pearson's Correlation Coefficient


$$ r =\frac{ cov_{xy} }{s_{x}s_{y}}$$


$$r =\frac{ cov_{xy} }{s_{x}s_{y}}=\\ =\frac{ 4.25 }{1.67\times2.92 } = \\= .87$$

### Things to Know about the Correlation

- It varies between -1 and +1
  + 0 = no relationship
- It is an effect size
  + ±.1 = small effect
  + ±.3 = medium effect
  + ±.5 = large effect
- Coefficient of determination, $r^2$
  + By squaring the value of r you get the proportion of variance in one variable shared by the other. Variance accounted for by…

## 2. Non-parametric measures


### Non-parametric Correlations


**(some) assumptions of Pearson’s Correlation:**

- Interval or ratio scale data
- Normally distributed

**We can then use:**

- [Spearman’s rho](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIfISCTEE2M&feature=youtu.be)
  - Pearson’s correlation on the ranked data
- [Kendall’s tau](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXVxaSoY94k)
  - Better than Spearman’s for small samples

![](images/parametriccomic.png)


### Exercise: More Correlation Testing in R

- Load the The Biggest Liar.dat file into R.
  - 68 participants, variables indicate where they were placed in the competition (first, second, third, etc.), Creativity questionnaire (maximum score 60)
  - Make a prediction about the relationship between position in the competition and creativity and test it using the `cor.test()` function use method spearman and kendall
    - What did you observe? Was there a significant correlation? What is the size (small, medium, large)? Do both analyses give you similar conclusions?
    - How would you report your findings? Try to summarize your results in a write up.  

### 1. Loading The Biggest Liar data

Load the dataset and store it in a variable called liar_data. In this online envionrment it also comes preloaded 


```{r ex1, exercise=TRUE}
# liar_data <- read.delim("data/The Biggest Liar.dat")

# Make a prediction about the relationship between position in the competition and creativity and test it using the `cor.test()` function. Use the spearman and kendall methods.

```
```{r ex1-hint}
#Add exact argument to avoid warning
cor.test(liar_data$Position, liar_data$Creativity,method="spearman", alternative = 'less', exact=FALSE)
cor.test(liar_data$Creativity,liar_data$Position, method="kendall", alternative = 'less')
```
```{r ex1-check}
#store
```


### Correlation and Causality

- The third-variable problem:
  - In any correlation, causality between two variables cannot be assumed because there may be other measured or unmeasured variables affecting the results.
- Direction of causality:
  - Correlation coefficients say nothing about which variable causes the other to change.

Check [this out](https://tylervigen.com/discover) for some interesting spurious correlations

## 3. Partial and Semi-partial Correlations

### Correlations:

- Partial correlation:
  - Measures the relationship between two variables, controlling for the effect that a third variable has **on them both.**
- Semi-partial correlation:
  - Measures the relationship between two variables controlling for the effect that a third variable has **on only one of the others.**

     style="max-width: 100%;" />


### Partial and Semi-partial Correlations

Use for when you think that the confounding variable does not influence both variables.

### Doing Partial Correlation using R

- Need ‘ppcor’ package
- The general form of `pcor.test()` is:
  - `pcor.test(x,y,z)`
- X and Y are the main variables of interest
- Z is the one you want to control for

### Doing Semi-Partial Correlation using R

- The general form of `spcor.test()` is:
  - `spcor.test(x,y,z)`
- X and Y are the main variables of interest
- Z is the one you want to control for, and it’s relationship with Y (the second variable entered) 


### Exercise 3: Partial and Semi-Partial Correlation Testing in R

- Load the Exam Anxiety.dat file into R.
- Install and load the `ppcor` package
- Optional: Create a new data frame that only contains the variables "Exam","Anxiety","Revise“
  - Run partial correlation test to see the relationship between exam score and revision time, while controlling for anxiety (use `pcor.test()`)
  - Run a semi-partial correlation test to see the relationship between exam score and revision time, while controlling for the effect of anxiety on exam score only (use `spcor.test()`)

### 1. Run individual tests

Store the data in a variable called exam_data2. In this online enivonrnment data also comes pre-loaded under varaiable exam_data2

```{r ex2, exercise=TRUE}
#library(ppcor)
exam_data2 <-read.delim(file="data/Exam Anxiety.dat",header=TRUE)
# Optional: create new data frames

# Run partial correlation test to see the relationship between exam score and revision time, while controlling for anxiety (use `pcor.test()`)

#  Run a semi-partial correlation test to see the relationship between exam score and revision time, while controlling for the effect of anxiety on exam score only (use `spcor.test()`)

# Test them all at once

# Alternative methods

```
```{r ex2-hint}
pcor.test(exam_data2$Revise,exam_data2$Exam,exam_data2$Anxiety)
spcor.test(exam_data2$Revise,exam_data2$Exam,exam_data2$Anxiety)

pcor(exam_data2)
spcor(exam_data2)

pc<-pcor(c("Exam","Anxiety","Revise"),var(exam_data2))
#The 1 indicates we are only controlling for 1 variable, and the 103 is the sample size
pcor.test(pc,1,103) 
```
```{r ex2-check}
#store
```



### Easystats: correlation package

![](images/easystats.png)

### Load packages 

In this online envionrnment packages already come pre-loaded.

```{r ex3, exercise=TRUE}

# Use correlation

# Plot results of correlation

# Partial correlations


```
```{r ex3-hint}
#library pcor
results <- correlation(exam_data2)


results %>%
  summary(redundant = TRUE) %>%
  plot()

exam_data %>%
 correlation(partial=TRUE) %>%
summary()

```
```{r ex3-check}
#store
```



## Conculsion

## Summing Up

- Correlations
  - Positive, negative and range from -1 to 1
  - Small, medium, large effects
  - Not causal
- Non parametric
  - If data are non-interval/ratio or non normal
- Partial/semi-partial correlations
