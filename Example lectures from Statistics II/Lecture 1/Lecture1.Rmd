- BSc in Biology (Radboud Univ. Nijmegen)
- MSc in Medical Biology / Neurobiology (Radboud Univ. Nijmegen)
- PhD in Cognitive Neuroscience/Neuroimaging (Donders Institute)
- Postdoctoral researcher in Cognitive Neuroscience at Princeton University
- Assistant Professor at TiU since August 2020


**Research:** Already in my BSc I had an interest in both biology and psychology. Cognitive Neuroscience/neuroimaging has both of these represented which is why I chose that field. I study memory, and in particular episodic memory, using cognitive tasks and functional MRI. I find it intriguing to discover how people remember the world around them and their experiences, and how they learn from it. 

**Personal:** In my spare time I enjoy reading, pretty much anything from detectives to romance to sci-fi, and I like to bake, cakes, cookies, etc :)

## Quiz

### What do you remember from stats I?

### Question 1

```{r Quiz1,  echo=FALSE}
question("If I measure your knowledge of statistics before and at the end of the course, and I wan't to see if you improved, what would be an appropriate test to make this comparison?",
    answer("Factorial ANOVA"),
    answer("Paired-samples t-test", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Chi-square"),
    answer("Independent samples t-test"),
    answer("Correlation"),
    incorrect = "Hint: Try again, you can pick another answer!",
    allow_retry = TRUE
    )
```

### Results

#### 1. If I measure your knowledge of statistics before and at the end of the course, and I wan't to see if you improved, what would be an appropriate test to make this comparison?

```{r, Quiz1O, echo = FALSE}
plotOutput("Q1")
```

```{r, Quiz1R, context="server", echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align = "center"}
output$Q1 <- renderPlot({
  
  data <- dbGetQuery(pool, select_query)

## Probability Basics

### Taco Literacy

- What if I told you a recent survey of 1000 Europeans showed that  72% of people were taco illiterate? 
  - 720 out of 1000 did not understand the important anatomical components and historical lineage of tacos. 
  - Would you expect 72% if you were to sample 10,000 Europeans? 
  - What if we found the number went down to 43%?

     style="max-width: 100%;" />


### Why do we need probability theory? 


- We use inferential statistics to answer questions about how representative our data are of  the population
- The core of the science 
- Probabilities form the basis for statistical inference. 

<img src="images/probability.png" 
     style="max-width: 100%;" />




### Probability vs Statistics



<img src="images/probabilitybucket.png" 
     style="max-width: 100%;" />

### Frequentist vs Bayesian view

<img src="images/bayes.png" 
     style="max-width: 100%;" />

### Probability Distributions


- Elementary events – For a given observation, the outcome will be one and only one of these events. 
- Sample space – the set of total possible events

- P(X) = 0-1

- <u>Sum of all probabilities is 1</u>

- Non elementary events
  - E.g. wearing jeans
  - P(E)= P(X1)+ P(X2)+ P(X3)

<img src="images/jeansgraph.png" 
     style="max-width: 100%;" />
     
<img src="images/jeanstable.png" 
     style="max-width: 100%;" />
     
### Binomial distribution


- Based on $\theta$ **success probability** 
  - E.g., number of successful tails in a coin flip, number during a dice roll
- N = number of observations or size parameter
- X is generated randomly from the distribution

$$P(X|\theta,N)$$

$$X \sim Bionomial(\theta,N)$$

<img src="images/BinomialDistribution.png" 
     style="max-width: 100%;" />


### Binomial Distribution in R

<img src="images/exerciseBinomial.png" 
     style="max-width: 100%;" />


```{r}
dbinom(x=4,size=20, prob=1/6)

```     


| What it does   | Prefix   | Normal distribution  | Binomial distribution |
| ----------------- |:-------------:|:-----:|--------|
| probability(density) of  | d      | `dnorm()`    | `dbinom()` |
| cumulative probability of  | p         | `pnorm()` | `pbinom()` |
| generate random number from | r        | `rnorm()` |  `rbinom()` |
| quantile of      | q  | `qnorm()` | `qbinom()` |



### Visualize the binomial distribution:

```{r ex11, exercise=TRUE}
dbinom(x=4,size=20, prob=1/6)

```
```{r ex11-hint}
#run the code
x <- seq(0,50,by=1) #Generate a series of values 0-50
y <- dbinom(x,50,prob=1/2)
plot(x,y, type='h', col='blue')

```
```{r ex11-check}
#store
```

### Give it a try:

1. If I request 50 tacos from a restaurant that serves both hard shell and soft shell tacos, what is the probability that 25 of them are soft shell?

2. I want to have a pizza party and order 20 pizzas. Pizzas can either have meat on them or not meat. What is the probability that 6 of the pizzas are vegetarian friendly? 

3.  I spend too much time trying to pick a movie to watch on Netflix so I create a program to choose something for me at random. I only allow my program to choose the following genres: comedy, action, sci-fi, drama, or thriller. If I watch 50 movies using my program, what is the probability that I watch 17 comedies? 


### Exercise 1: 

- If I request 50 tacos from a restaurant that serves both hard shell and soft shell tacos, what is the probability that 25 of them are soft shell?


```{r ex12, exercise=TRUE}


```
```{r ex12-hint}
y <- dbinom(x=25,size=50,prob=1/2)
print(y)

```
```{r ex12-check}
#store
```


### Exercise 2:

- I want to have a pizza party and order 20 pizzas. Pizzas can either have meat on them or not meat. What is the probability that 6 of the pizzas are vegetarian friendly?

```{r ex13, exercise=TRUE}


```
```{r ex13-hint}
x <- seq(0,20,by=1) #Generate a series of values 0-20
y <- dbinom(x,20,prob=1/2)
plot(x,y, type='h', col='blue')

y<-dbinom(x=6,size=20,prob=1/2)
print(y)

```
```{r ex13-check}
#store
```


### Exercise 3: 

- I spend too much time trying to pick a movie to watch on Netflix so I create a program to choose something for me at random. I only allow my program to choose the following genres: comedy, action, sci-fi, drama, or thriller. If I watch 50 movies using my program, what is the probability that I watch 17 comedies? 


```{r ex14, exercise=TRUE}


```
```{r ex14-hint}
x <- seq(0,50,by=1) #Generate a series of values of 0-50
y <- dbinom(x,50,prob=1/5)
plot(x,y, type='h', col='blue')

y<- dbinom(x=17,size=50,prob=1/5)
print(y)
```
```{r ex14-check}
#store
```



### Normal distribution

- Most important in statistics!
- Called Bell Curve of Gaussian distribution
- Continuous distribution vs discrete case for binomial


$$X \sim Normal(\mu, \sigma)$$

<img src="images/normaldistribution.png" 
     style="max-width: 100%;" />


### Normal distribution 

$X \sim Normal(\mu, \sigma)$

- What happens when we change, the mean or the SD of a normal distribution?


<img src="images/figure9.6.png" 
     style="max-width: 100%;" /> | <img src="images/figure9.7.png" 
     style="max-width: 100%;" /> 
     
     
### Normal distribution

- **Area under the curve must equal 1**

<img src="images/areaundercurve.png" 
     style="max-width: 100%;" />


### t distribution

- Similar to normal
- Heavy tails
- Used in t-tests, regression, and more
- Used when you expect data are normally distributed, but don’t know mean or SD
- R code:
  - `dt()`, `pt()`,`qt()`,`rt()`

<img src="images/figure9.10.png" 
     style="max-width: 100%;" />

### Chi-squared distribution 

$\chi^2$

- Often used in categorical data analysis
- Shows up everywhere
- ‘Sum of squares’ follow this distribution
- R code:
  - `dchisq()`, `pchisq ()`,`qchisq ()`,`rchisq ()`

<img src="images/figure9.11.png" 
     style="max-width: 100%;" />

### F distribution 

- When you need to compare two chi-square distributions
- Comparing two sums of squares
- R code:
  - `df()`, `pf()`,`qf()`,`rf()`

<img src="images/figure9.12.png" style="max-width: 100%;" />


## Exercises

### Questions (use R below if you need it)

- What is the probability of drawing the queen of hearts from a deck of cards?
- What is the probability that I will draw a card with a black figure on it?
- If I draw 30 cards from the deck and replace each card afterward, what is the probability that I will draw the jack of spades 5 times? 

<img src="images/cards.png" 
     style="max-width: 100%;" />


```{r ex15, exercise=TRUE}

```
```{r ex15-hint}
queen<-dbinom(x=1,size=1,prob=1/52)
blck<-dbinom(x=1,size=1,prob=1/2)
jack<-dbinom(x=5,size=30,prob=1/52)
```
```{r ex15-check}
#store
```
