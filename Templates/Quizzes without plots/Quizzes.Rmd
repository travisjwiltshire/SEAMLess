###### INFORMATION ABOUT THE YAML OPTIONS ABOVE ################################

## You can edit the options between --- --- to your preference, at a a minimum you can change the title and author to fit your file

## allow: skip above means that students are not forced to complete quizzes or exercises before proceeding, they can skip things
## If you want to force completion, change it to allow_skip: false

## progressive: true is about how content is revealed. When set to true, content is shown chunk by chunk and you press continue
## to reveal the next part. If you want to show everything at once, change this to progressive: false

## If you do not want to use a custom css file, you can delete the css: css/style.css line. If you want to change the css,
## edit the style.css file provided in the css folder

## The theme changes the overall visual layout, you can choose from the following options: ("rstudio", default", "cerulean", "journal", "flatly", "readable", "spacelab", "united", "cosmo", "lumen", "paper", "sandstone", "simplex", or "yeti"). These are based on bootstrap themes.
